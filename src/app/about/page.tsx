    "I am a 4th-year student from the University of Arizona. I have always been one to jump before thinking things through, and that is how I discovered coding. Along the way, I realized that computer science is much more than just programmingâ€”it is about problem-solving, adaptability, and curiosity. In the last four years, I have learned about myself, from organizing my time more efficiently to working smarter every day.
